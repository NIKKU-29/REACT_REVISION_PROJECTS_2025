# 🚀 React Revision Projects 2025

This repository is a collection of React projects built from **scratch** — ranging from **Beginner** to **Intermediate** to **Advanced** levels. The goal is to help you revise core React concepts and challenge yourself as a developer.

Whether you’ve just completed a React course or are revisiting topics, this repo ensures you **solidify your knowledge** by working on structured, hands-on projects.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### 📦 Install Dependencies

This repo does **not** include pre-installed `node_modules`. After cloning the project, make sure to run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary dependencies.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack Used

- **React** (via [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)) for fast development and Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and responsive UI styling
- **ESLint** for linting and code style enforcement
- Optional: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for consistent formatting

> If you're new to Tailwind, check out their [docs here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## 🧪 What You'll Learn

Each project in this repo is designed to revise or reinforce topics like:

- JSX and component structure
- Props and state
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, etc.)
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering and keys
- Forms and controlled components
- React Router
- Custom hooks
- Context API and state management
- Animations (e.g., Framer Motion)
- API integration (REST and possibly GraphQL)
- Performance optimization and advanced patterns

## 💡 Why This Repo?

I'm building these projects **myself** to:

- Test and brush up my React knowledge
- Create reusable project templates
- Challenge myself with real-world scenarios

You can follow along, fork this repo, and build your own versions. Add your own twist to each project or contribute if you'd like!

## 🧠 Who Is This For?

- Developers who’ve just finished learning React and want real-world practice
- Developers coming back to React after a break
- Intermediate devs looking to reinforce concepts and level up
- Anyone who enjoys building projects instead of just reading docs
